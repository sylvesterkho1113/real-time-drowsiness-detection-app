# Real-Time Drowsiness Detection Using Facial Cues via a Mobile Application

**ðŸ“Œ About the Project**
This project is my **Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) (Artificial Intelligence)** Final Year Project.
It focuses on developing a **mobile application** that detects driver drowsiness in real-time using **Facial Cues** captured cia the smartphone camera.
The application will leverages the **Computer Vision and Machine Learning** techniques to analyze facial features and alert drivers when sign of fatigue are detacted. This solution is especially useful for drivers, shift workers, or individuals in high-risk environments, helping to prevent accidents and improve safety without requiring extra hardware.
